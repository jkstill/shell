This is fast, but depends on many global variables:


f() {
   RVAL='jeremiah was a bullfrog'
}

f
echo "RVAL: $RVAL"

Each function needs a global variable for its return values.

Using the following method is much neater, but suffers from performane issues.
(see ../function-test/README)

f() {
   echo 'jeremiah was a bullfrog'
}

RVAL=$(f)


An alternative might be something like this:
(Bash only)

declare -A rVals

f() {
   rVals[$FUNCNAME]='jeremiah was a bullfrog'
}


f
echo "Value: " ${rVals['f']}

There is only 1 global variable, the rVals associative array.

Using the name of the called function as a key values retrieves the most recent value returned.

see f-retvals.sh
