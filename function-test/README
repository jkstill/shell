Does calling functions in the following manner to return
strings add significant overhead?

Or does bash optimize this away?

Let's find out.

################
## t1.sh
################

Uses a global variable to return a value

10k iterations:

> time ./t1.sh 10000
test type: functional run
RVAL:
RVAL: jeremiah was a bullfrog
i: 10000
i: 0

real    0m0.074s
user    0m0.064s
sys     0m0.012s


################
## t2.sh
################

Uses a subshell to return the value.

> time ./t2.sh 10000
test type: functional run
RVAL:
RVAL: jeremiah was a bullfrog
i: 10000
i: 0

real    0m2.430s
user    0m0.340s
sys     0m0.668s

#########################

It is clear that bash is not doing any optimizations for returning values with a subshell.

The global variable method is 32x faster.
